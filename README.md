### Restful API

This project is to follow the [Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) by Mosh. Besides just Express and writing RESTful routes this project will help to learn how to use _JSON schemas_, test your API's with _Postman_, use _environmental variables-, and practice continuous development using \_nodemon_.
